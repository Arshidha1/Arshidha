<p>A framework in software development is a standardized set of concepts, practices, and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem. It provides a foundation upon which software developers can build programs for a specific platform. Frameworks are designed to make the development process more efficient by providing pre-written code, tools, and libraries that handle common tasks, allowing developers to focus on writing the unique parts of their applications.

   <h2> Key Features of a Framework:</h2>
    <b>Code Reusability:</b>
    
    Frameworks provide a lot of pre-written code that can be reused, reducing the amount of code developers need to write from scratch.<br><br>
<b>Standardization:</b>
    
    They provide a standardized way of building and organizing applications, which can improve code quality and maintainability.<br><br>
<b>Efficiency:</b>
    
    By handling common tasks, frameworks can significantly speed up the development process, allowing developers to focus on the unique aspects of their applications.<br><br>
<b>Abstraction:</b>
    
    Frameworks abstract complex, low-level details, providing a simpler interface for developers to work with. This can make it easier to develop complex applications.<br><br>
<b> Community and Support:</b>
    
    Popular frameworks often have large communities, extensive documentation, and support, making it easier for developers to find help and resources.</p>
