<center><h2>Javascript</h2></center>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used to create dynamic and interactive effects within web browsers. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript enables developers to enhance user interfaces, validate forms, create animations, and much more.

        <h2>Key Features of JavaScript:</h2>
        <b>Interpreted Language:</b>
        
        JavaScript is executed by the web browser, making it an interpreted language rather than a compiled one. This allows for immediate execution of code without the need for a separate compilation step.<br><br>
       <b> Client-Side Scripting:</b>
        
        JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, meaning it runs on the user's web browser rather than on a web server. This enables interactive web pages and dynamic content updates without needing to reload the page.<br><br>
    <b>Event-Driven Programming:</b>
        
        JavaScript can respond to user actions such as clicks, mouse movements, and keystrokes through event handling, making it ideal for creating responsive user interfaces.<br><br>
    <b> Object-Oriented:</b>
        
        JavaScript supports object-oriented programming principles, allowing developers to create reusable objects and classes.<br><br>
    <b> Versatility:</b>
        
        Beyond web browsers, JavaScript can also be used on the server-side (using Node.js), for mobile app development (using frameworks like React Native), and even for desktop applications..</p>
