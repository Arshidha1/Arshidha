<p >CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

<h3>Key Features of CSS:</h3>
<b>Separation of Content and Presentation:</b>

CSS allows the separation of document content (written in HTML or a similar markup language) from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.<br><br>
<b>Cascading Nature:</b>

The term "cascading" refers to the way CSS rules are applied in a hierarchy, where multiple style rules can affect the same element. The final appearance is determined by the order and specificity of these rules.<br><br><b>Selectors and Properties:</b>

CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles. Selectors can be simple (like targeting an element by its tag name, class, or ID) or complex (like targeting elements based on their position in the document hierarchy).
Properties define the specific style aspects, such as color, font-size, margin, and padding.<br><bR>
<b>Responsive Design:</b><br>

CSS supports responsive design through media queries, allowing web pages to adjust their layout and style based on the device's characteristics, such as screen size, resolution, and orientation.</p>
